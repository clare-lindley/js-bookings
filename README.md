# js-bookings: REST API to learn the HAPI Framework and Mongoose

**Testing:**   
Uses the '[Lab](https://github.com/hapijs/lab)' testing Framework + the '[Code](https://github.com/hapijs/code)' Assertion Library  
**To run the tests:** `npm test`

**Usage:**  
1. Run `npm init` to get the dependencies  
2. To start the server: `node index.js`      

The server is running at localhost:3000      

**Currently taking a break from this API dev malarkey to get my head around
how the hell to handle uncaught exceptions in node! :S ???
