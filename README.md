# js-bookings: REST API to learn the HAPI Framework and Mongoose

**Testing:**   
Uses the 'Lab' testing Framework + the 'Code' Assertion Library  
**To run the tests:** npm test

**Usage:**  
**To start the server:** node index.js    

The server is running at localhost:3000    

**Currently taking a break from this API dev to get my head around
how the hell to handle uncaught exceptions in node! :S ???
